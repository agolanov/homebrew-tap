Homebrew-Tap
==============
This repository contains my personal formulae as well as in-development formulae intended to be added to [my Homebrew fork][sceaga] and pull requested in the future.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap sceaga/tap` and then `brew install <formula>` if there's anything you'd fancy having. If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install sceaga/tap/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/sceaga/homebrew-tap/master/<formula>.rb
```

Docs
----
`brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki][].
